# Input
The application starts with a predefined array of movie objects, each containing a title, genre, and release year. The user interacts with a genre filter dropdown and clickable movie items.

# Process
The application is built using React functional components and hooks. It filters the movie list based on the selected genre from the dropdown menu. If "All Genres" is selected, the full list is displayed. When a movie item is clicked, an alert shows the movie's title. The component dynamically updates the UI in response to state changes triggered by user actions.

# Output
Filtered movie results are rendered as individual list items based on the selected genre. The UI updates in real time without reloading the page. Each movie is displayed with its title, genre, and release year. When clicked, a browser alert pops up showing the selected movieâ€™s title. This enhances interactivity while maintaining a simple and responsive user experience.
